Food Vision Project: Binary Classification for Computer Vision

The Food Vision Project is an exciting venture in computer vision that focuses on binary image classification. 
This deep learning project is designed to accurately distinguish between two classes of images: "food" and "non-food." 
It leverages state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques to achieve high accuracy and efficiency in classifying 
food-related images.

Key Features:

Image Preprocessing: The project includes comprehensive image preprocessing steps to ensure optimal model performance and data consistency.
Binary Classification Model: A powerful CNN-based binary classification model is developed, fine-tuned, and trained on a large dataset of food and non-food images.
Transfer Learning: The project incorporates transfer learning from pre-trained models, enabling efficient learning and faster convergence.
Evaluation Metrics: Various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are utilized to assess the model's binary classification performance.
Real-World Application: The Food Vision Project demonstrates practical applications of computer vision in food detection, offering potential uses in food recognition and dietary analysis.

Whether you are a student, researcher, or enthusiast in computer vision and deep learning, the Food Vision Project provides valuable insights into building effective 
binary classification models for real-world image recognition tasks
